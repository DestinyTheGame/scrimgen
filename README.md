> If you're looking for the website, it can be found at https://destinythegame.github.io/scrims/

This is a small GitHub Page that hosts a Destiny 2 map generator for scrims. You simply visit
the site, and it will automatically show 3 **random** maps that should be played.

## Development

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Make changes in the `index.html`
3. Create a PR back to this repository with the changes
4. ???
5. Profit.

It's as simple as that, just a `index.html` file that contains all the logic. As it's a
GitHub Page, it will automatically update the site when commit lands in the `main` branch.
